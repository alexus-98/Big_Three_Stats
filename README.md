## Big_Three_Stats

This is a final project for the course Advanced Visualisation in R, that was held in the first year of my master studies. 
It concers visual comparison of statistcs of the Big Three tennis players: Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic (the order of surnames is not random).

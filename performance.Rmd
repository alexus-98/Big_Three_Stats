### Performance on different surfaces

On the first plot a comparison between Big Three players on different surfaces is presented. It helps us understand how effective each of the players is in terms of winning matches. Values are given both in absolute and percentage terms.
All of the players have outstanding win to loose ratios, but some visible differences are present. Djokovic has been the most consistent among the Big Three across three main surfaces, having at least 80% of wins at each. Federer however has the best results on grass courts (88% of wins), while Nadal is the undisputed king of clay (92% of wins).
